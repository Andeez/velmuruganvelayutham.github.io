<p>Here is a short overview of the differences between HTTP requests that are sent directly to the destination and HTTP requests that are sent via a proxy.</p>
<h3>Proxy Traffic vs. Normal Traffic</h3>
<p>Following is the main figure for this article. It shows the two different packet types:</p>
<p><strong>Direct HTTP requests:</strong> Destination IP is the HTTP server and the requested URI shows only the path behind the domain.<br />
<strong>HTTP proxy requests:</strong> First packet is sent to the proxy. The requested URI shows the complete URL (host + path). The second packet is sent from the proxy to the final destination. And since it is a “real” proxy, both packets are inside its own TCP connection with different source addresses as well.</p>
<p>In both scenarios, the “Host” value in the HTTP request is set to the requested domain. In the case of a proxy, the HTTP X-Forwarded-For header with the client IP address might be inserted.</p>
<p>Note that the arrows in the figure show only the first HTTP packet flow, though it is a bi-directional communication in which the returning packets have the inverse order of source/destination IPs and ports.</p>

<p>As an example, I opened my What-is-my-IP script at http://ip.webernetz.net two times: The first one without a proxy and the second one with a proxy on port 3128. (Note that the proxy server can run on different ports, e.g., 80, 8080, 3128.) The proxy IP came from a free proxy list (link below).<br />
